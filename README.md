# 📊 **Sales Analytics Project (Python + Excel + VBA)**

### **1.	Project Overview**

This project is an end-to-end Sales Analytics solution built using (Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Excel, Pivot Tables, and VBA).
It demonstrates my ability to clean raw data, perform statistical analysis, create visual insights, build an interactive Excel dashboard, and automate sorting using VBA.

The project helps understand sales performance , customer trends , product demand , and monthly growth patterns.


### **2. Tools & Technologies Used**

⦁	Python : Pandas , NumPy , Matplotlib

⦁	Excel : Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Formatting

⦁	VBA : Button-based sorting macro

⦁	IDE : PyCharm

⦁	File Formats : CSV, XLSX


### **3. Data Cleaning & Processing (Python)**

Performed in Python to generate a clean dataset:

⦁	 Handled missing values

⦁	 Corrected data types (dates, integers, strings)

⦁	 Removed duplicates

⦁	 Added calculated fields

⦁	 Generated summary statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles

### **4. Visualizations Created**

⦁	 Total Sales distribution charts as per product line , city , months , customers created using Matplotlib

⦁	 Summary statistics using NumPy

⦁	 Insights on sales spread using standard deviation and percentile


### **5. Excel Dashboard**

 Includes:

⦁	 KPI Cards (Top Product, Total Sales, Total Quantity, Region Performance)

⦁	 Sales by Month (bar chart)

⦁	 Region-wise Sales (pivot chart)

⦁	 Product Performance Table

⦁	 Clean, minimal formatting for recruiter readability

### **6. Interactive Elements**

⦁	VBA-based “Click to Sort” button to sort through various categories

⦁	 Slicers for dynamic filtering

⦁	 All pivot tables placed on separate sheets based on the different categories for a clean and easy to understand analysis



### **7. Key Insights**

⦁	Classic Cars generated the highest revenue among all product lines, amounting to ₹1,67,950.15.

⦁	Melbourne emerged as the top-performing city, contributing ₹1,97,226.69 in total sales, which is nearly 40% of the overall revenue.

⦁	November recorded the highest monthly sales with ₹95,028.15 and 888 units ordered.

⦁	Monthly sales fluctuations show a clear seasonal pattern, indicating increased demand during certain months and slower performance during others.
